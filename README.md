## Cześć!

In Polish means "Hello!". 

jog1t pronounced as "yogit", similar to yogurt without the "ur".

Below you can find some of my ideas and projects that came to my mind. For various reasons they are not finished nor started. My brain, keeps dumping ideas and I can't stop thinking about them until I write them down somewhere. It's a great way to clear my mind and focus on the task at hand.

Maybe you will find something interesting here, or maybe you will get inspired to create something on your own.

So here they are, in no particular order.

btw. those are not AI generated ideas, those are all mine, collected over the years ;)

#### Witty Wits

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Started, not finished, abandoned due to lack of motivation.

A multiplayer online game where players compete in real-time to solve witty puzzles and challenges, testing their creativity and quick thinking. Similar to "Dumb Ways to Die", or Jackbox games. 

The twist is that the game screen should be displayed on TV, while players use their smartphones to interact and answer questions, similar to Kahoot.


#### Guess the Song

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

Utilities Spotify API to run audio clips of your favorite songs, and players have to guess the song title and artist as quickly as possible.


#### Code RTS

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

A real-time strategy game where players write code to control their units and build their bases. Players can use different programming languages to create strategies and tactics to outsmart their opponents. Similar to "Screeps" game, but open source and hosted directly on Durable Objects giving players no limits in terms of scalability.

#### Hungry Villagers (Mayors Village)

Type: Minecraft Mod

Status: Started, abandoned due to lack of skills and interest.

Always hungry villagers that need to be fed by players. While playing Minecraft always the world felt empty, and without any major goal. I love playing cooking games, so I though why not combine both?

There are plenty of mods that introduce foods, mechanics to produce food, automate farming, but none of them really give players a goal to achieve. Why would you bother to farm if there is no real need for food? Only for yourself, but what about villagers?

The idea is to create a mod where villagers are always hungry and need to be fed by players. Players can cook different dishes using other mods, and villagers will reward them with items, trades, or even help in defending the village from mobs. The more villagers you feed, the more prosperous your village becomes. Your reputation grows, and villagers start to trust you more, offering better trades and assistance.

You start with a small "restaurant" in the village, from time to time a villager approaches you asking for food. You can prepare simple dishes using basic ingredients. As you feed more villagers, your restaurant gains popularity, attracting more villagers with diverse tastes. You can expand your menu, experiment with recipes, and even host special events to draw in larger crowds.

#### Comsodrone

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

Found the name a fun little word play - cosmos and drone. Similar to Code RTS, but focused on drones that can be programmed to perform various tasks, such as surveillance, delivery, or combat. Players can write code to control their drones and complete missions.

You're a talented engineer, who is tasked to program a space drone to gather, research and build facilities on the planet far, far away from your homeland.

The space drone receives commands like "goForward" "turnLeft", and the code is written in JS.

You can simulate how the drone will behave thanks to highly advanced technology. 

After testing, you can deploy it to space, and watch their journey on the planet.

But watch out, other Space Facilities have the same mission as our - domicile as many planets as possible. Conquer other drones, salvage and survive, fulfil the board's tasks, get rewarded, become the best space engineer.


#### Unknown named ('From' series inspired game)

Type: Game

Status: Researched, not started.

Similar to [Dark Wood](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/) game, where players needs to survive in a village with other players and villagers. Creatures, hostile mobs, similarly to the From series, can only attack at night, but they appear like other villagers or players during the day. Players need to gather resources, build shelters, and defend themselves from the creatures at night.

#### Plan B / Rainday

Type: Game

Status: Started, abandoned due to lack of motivation, skills.

Similar to PayDay, where players plan and execute heists with a team of other players. The twist is that the guards are other players, similarly to Rainbow Six Siege. Guards have access to security cameras, alarms, and other tools to prevent the heist. Players need to work together to overcome the guards and complete the heist.

#### Police Investigator AI

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

A game where players take on the role of a police investigator. You versus AI. You need to convince the AI to stop invading a building, by gathering evidence, interviewing witnesses, and solving puzzles. The AI will adapt to your strategies, making each playthrough unique.


#### Feed the Town

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

Idea based on Feed the Cups, where players can prepare anything - literally. All items that can be prepare are easy to install via package (steam workshop, or from the catalogue, - user generated) 


#### Ultimate Engineer

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

A game similar to Factorio, but focused more on integrating really complex supply chains. Similar to [Greg's Tech](https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/) mod for Minecraft, but as a standalone game. Players need to design and optimize their factories to produce various items, while managing resources, logistics, and production lines. Extendable via mods and user-generated content.


#### You, a Major

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

Similar to [Eco](https://store.steampowered.com/app/382310/Eco/) game, where players take on the role of a mayor of a small town. Players need to manage resources, build infrastructure, and make decisions that affect the town's growth and development. Town lives even if the player is offline, similarly to [Utopia](https://utopia-game.com/).


#### AI Civilization

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Researched, not started.

Similar to `Thronglets` from Netflix, and based on [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442) paper, where players can create and manage their own civilization of AI agents. Players can design their agents' personalities, skills, and behaviors, and watch them interact with each other and the environment. Players can also influence the civilization's development by making decisions and providing resources. Treating the game as a "fish tank" where you can observe how AI agents behave and interact with each other over time. 

This could be used for entertainment, education, or research purposes. Unfortunately running such a simulation would require a graphics card farm to run multiple LLM instances simultaneously, or a highly optimized LLM model that can run on a single machine with decent performance, or leveraging cloud computing resources to scale the simulation as needed (and lots of money). Please proof me wrong! Nonetheless it's still an interesting idea to explore.


#### Factory Simulation

Type: Game, web-based

Status: Just an idea.

Saw on TikTok and Twitter a lot of people complaining that the https://factoryio.com/ is paid. What if we do the similar thing, but just for funsies? I'd love to have some low level automation stuff with achievements, rewards and goals just for the sake of doing this.


#### Server Driven UI

Type: Frontend App Architecture

Status: Researched.

React has recenlty introduced [Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) that allows developers to do async operation inside their components. Those components are synced with the frontend. They can't use interactive hooks like useState or useEffect. What if we make an abstraction over Durable Objects that will allow you to write fully interactive Server Components?
